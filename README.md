A way to have fun while also practicing building defensive structures on backend applications

To simply test specific versions matching up against eachother:
```
python3 fight.py <attacker_version> <defender_version>
```

To play a king of the hill type exercise:
```
python3 fight.py --king <attacker_start_version> <defender_start_version>
```
